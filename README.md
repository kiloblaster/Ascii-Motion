## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cameronfoxly/Ascii-Motion.git
cd Ascii-Motion
npm install
```

### Development
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Build
```bash
npm run build
```

## 🚀 Deployment

This monorepo contains **three separate deployable apps**, each with its own Vercel project:

| App | Domain | Deploy From | Command |
|-----|--------|-------------|---------|
| **Main App** | `ascii-motion.app` | Root | `npm run deploy` |
| **Marketing** | `ascii-motion.com` | `packages/web/marketing` | `npx vercel --prod` |
| **Docs** | `docs.ascii-motion.com` | `packages/web/docs-site` | `npx vercel --prod` |

### Main App Deployment (Root)

The main ASCII art editor deploys with automated versioning:

<details>
  <summary>Available Deployment Commands</summary>

| Command | Version Increment | Use Case |
|---------|------------------|----------|
| `npm run deploy` | **Patch** (2.0.0 → 2.0.1) | Bug fixes, small updates |
| `npm run deploy:major` | **Minor** (2.0.1 → 2.1.0) | New features, significant improvements |
| `npm run deploy:preview` | **None** | Testing deployments, preview branches |

### Manual Version Commands

For version management without deployment:

```bash
# Increment patch version (2.0.0 → 2.0.1)
npm run version:patch

# Increment minor version (2.0.1 → 2.1.0) 
npm run version:minor

# Increment major version (2.1.0 → 3.0.0)
npm run version:major
```
</details>

### Marketing & Docs Site Deployment

These deploy **separately** from the main app using the Vercel CLI:

```bash
# Marketing site (ascii-motion.com)
cd packages/web/marketing
npx vercel --prod

# Docs site (docs.ascii-motion.com)
cd packages/web/docs-site
npx vercel --prod
```

See the README in each package for detailed deployment instructions.

## 📋 Development Status

This is currently maintained entirely by me, an animator and brand designer with next to no experience with building tools. This has been vibe-coded into existence using GitHub Copilot in VScode, using mostly Claude Opus 4.6, with the occasional GPT-5.2-Codex when Claude gets stumped. Please forgive any messy or unusal structure or vibe-code artifacts, I'm trying my best!

## 🤝 Contributing

We welcome contributions to the **open-source core** (`packages/core/`)!

### For Open Source Contributors

**What you can contribute:**
- ✅ New drawing tools and brushes
- ✅ Animation features and effects
- ✅ Export formats and converters
- ✅ UI/UX improvements
- ✅ Bug fixes and performance optimizations
- ✅ Documentation and examples

**What is proprietary:**
- ❌ Authentication system (`packages/premium/`)
- ❌ Cloud storage features
- ❌ Payment integration

### Monorepo Setup for Contributors

**Important:** This project uses a monorepo structure with a private Git submodule for premium features.

#### Project Structure
```
Ascii-Motion/               # Main repository (public)
├── packages/
│   ├── core/              # Open source (MIT) - You work here!
│   │   ├── src/
│   │   │   ├── components/
│   │   │   ├── stores/
│   │   │   ├── hooks/
│   │   │   └── utils/
│   │   └── package.json
│   └── premium/           # Private submodule (Proprietary)
│       └── (not accessible to contributors)
├── src/                   # Legacy code (being migrated to core)
└── package.json           # Root workspace config
```

#### Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cameronfoxly/Ascii-Motion.git
   cd Ascii-Motion
   npm install
   ```

2. **The `packages/premium/` folder will be empty** - This is expected! You don't need it to contribute. The app runs without premium features.

3. **Development:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev          # Start dev server
   npm run test:run     # Run tests (343 tests)
   npm run lint         # Check code quality
   npm run build        # Production build
   ```

4. **All source code lives in `src/`** — not in `packages/core/` (which is a shared UI component library). Your contributions go directly in `src/`.

5. **Key files to know:**
   - `src/stores/timelineStore.ts` — Primary state (layers, keyframes, timeline)
   - `src/hooks/useKeyboardShortcuts.ts` — All keyboard shortcuts and undo/redo
   - `src/components/features/ToolPalette.tsx` — Tool UI and options
   - `src/utils/exportRenderer.ts` — All export format rendering
   - `src/types/timeline.ts` — Core type definitions

#### Import Paths

When writing code in `src/`, use these import patterns:

```typescript
// Stores
import { useTimelineStore } from '../stores/timelineStore';
import { useCanvasStore } from '../stores/canvasStore';
import { useToolStore } from '../stores/toolStore';

// Utils
import { screenToLocal } from '../utils/layerTransformUtils';
import { compositeLayersAtFrame } from '../utils/layerCompositing';

// Types
import type { Layer, ContentFrame, KeyframeId } from '../types/timeline';

// UI Components
import { Button } from '../components/ui/button';
```

#### What Happens to Premium Code?

- The main app (`src/` folder) imports from both `core` and `premium`
- When you run `npm run dev` from the root, both packages are built
- **If `packages/premium/` is missing,** the app will still work but without auth/cloud features
- Your contributions to `core` are completely independent of premium features

#### Testing Your Changes

```bash
# Run the full test suite (343 tests)
npm run test:run

# Run tests in watch mode during development
npm test

# Lint check
npm run lint

# TypeScript type check
npx tsc --noEmit

# Production build verification
npm run build
```

#### Submitting Pull Requests

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/amazing-tool`
3. Make your changes in `packages/core/`
4. Commit with clear messages: `git commit -m "Add gradient brush tool"`
5. Push to your fork: `git push origin feature/amazing-tool`
6. Open a Pull Request to the `main` branch

**PR Checklist:**
- [ ] Changes don't modify premium code (`packages/premium/`)
- [ ] Code follows existing patterns and TypeScript strict mode
- [ ] Tests pass (`npm run test:run`)
- [ ] No linting errors (`npm run lint`)
- [ ] Build succeeds (`npm run build`)
- [ ] New features include tests where applicable
- [ ] PR description explains what and why
